# A Covid 19 tracker

In these pandemic times, we need a tracker about how confirmed, deaths, and recovered Covid 19 cases.

This app does the same and gives accurate results and also shows it in a form of a pie chart.

Select any valid country in the world and it will show the active, confirmed, deaths, and recovered covid 19 cases.

# Modules needed:

You will need to install some of the modules using www.pypi.org

You will need:

Hope you understand the code!

Thank you!
